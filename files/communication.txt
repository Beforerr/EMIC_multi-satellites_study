Hi Vassilis,

Please find enclosed the new version of the document. Here are the main revisions:

	•	Acceleration in Abstract: I’ve introduced acceleration at the beginning of the abstract to enhance clarity.
	•	Terminology Consistency: I’ve streamlined the use of terminology, opting for a consistent name between “whistler-mode chorus” and “chorus” and introduced what they mean at the beginning for clarity.
	•	Title and Terminology Updates: The term “low-energy” has been suppressed in the title, and throughout the text, I’ve replaced “low-energy electron injections” with “~100-300 keV seed electron injections” (or “injections of…”), starting in the Abstract and Introduction.
	•	Electron Terminology: I’ve replaced “source” electrons with “seed” electrons throughout the document, ensuring no confusion for readers regarding these electrons.
	•	Introduction Enhancements: I’ve added to the Introduction that injections also provide “~1-100 keV source ions and electrons” that generate EMIC and whistler-mode waves.

I hope these changes align with your expectations. Please let me know if there are any further adjustments or feedback you have.

Best regards,
Zijin

Hi Anton, I have incorporated all V's comments. Something I have not yet resolved:

1. consistent defintion of relativistic electrons.
2. removal of some part (I think it is fair to remove but I am not sure)
3. other small changes (added to Overleaf) like the mechanism of other direct injection.

Please let me know if you have any further comments.
