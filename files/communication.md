### Reviewer #1

This paper examines a particular geomagnetic storm by performing a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt by carefully examining the roles of the acceleration and loss processes. The paper is quite well written, well-referenced, and I recommend publication of this paper more or less as-is. However,there is one issue I would like the authors to consider. The modelling in this paper is rather piecemeal, comprising various not-necessarily-connected formulae from earlier studies. Of course, what the paper really requires
is a global simulation model connecting the various physical processes discussed(as pointed out by the authors), or indeed
a global analytical model. In the absence of such fully-global models,could the authors consider construction of a quasi-global
schematic diagram of the processes acting on the trapped fluxes?
That is,a schematic diagram connecting the physical processes given by the equations (1) - (6) ? If the authors could do this,
I think such a figure would strengthen the impact of their paper.

### Reviewer #2

This paper studies electrons and protons inside the inner magnetosphere observed on April 17, 2021 by a list of satellites. Using proxy, statistical distributions and simplified theoretical approximations, authors claim that in this weak storm event chorus-caused acceleration is proven outweigh the losses by EMIC combined with chorus waves to account for the observed net increase of relativistic electrons in the heart of outer belt region.

This work presents interesting results from a case study that could be useful for radiation belt research. However, there are a few major issues in the current version, and thus I would suggest the authors carefully address the following questions and suggestions before recommending its publication:

1. Please specify as early as possible the time interval that this study mainly focuses on to avoid confusions. Many observational data are presented here, and I had to wait until almost the end of the paper to figure out the primary target interval of this study: the flux increase of 0.5-1 MeV electrons at L~ 5.7 observed between ~7 - 10 UT as stated in lines 559-560. Please consider bringing it to the front, such as the end of Section 1 or beginning of Section 2, therefore readers will know which part of the data to focus on before being distracted and lost.

2. EMIC caused precipitation is only presented between ~2-6 UT in Figures 5 and 6, while chorus-led enhancements are mainly after ~7 UT. To claim chorus can overcome losses from EMIC+chorus and cause net increase of electrons (lines 35-37), there is a missing link that is to show EMIC caused precipitation is still active after ~7 UT simultaneously with chorus acceleration. Is there any reason ELFIN and POES data cannot be shown after 7 UT for EMIC-caused precipitation? Or, were you really trying to prove that different waves dominate consecutively at different times, which explains the electron losses and enhancements are observed at different storm phases? Please clarify it and make consistent your argument and evidence.

3. Results shown in Fig 8 are confusing when one compare ELFIN derived curves with the analytical estimates. Surely there seem to have intersections between dashed and solid lines, but the dashed lines can scale up and down with varying values of input parameters, and more importantly, how to understand the very different shapes of the solid and dashed curves? In addition, are those Daa and Dee values in Figures 8 and 10 only used for Equ (6) to generate the Jul curve? Indeed, I was expecting to see the Daa and Dee be used to explain the time scales of electron losses and enhancements as shown in Figure 11.

4. I am still confused how exactly the observed fluxes in Fig 11 are explained by acceleration from chorus waves, e.g., the results in Figure 10, so that it can claimed that enhancements from chorus overcome the losses from EMIC+chorus? Surely, I can speculate that the observed electron spectra, starting with a soft spectrum in maroon color in Figure 11, can get harder to match the blue J_ul curve, but how exactly the physics works is unclear to me. Also, any explanation in Figure 11a, the first observation at 0030 UT in black, assumingly with quiet geomagnetic conditions, has a shape very different from the J_ul curve in blue if the latter is the proposed stead-state shape (line 95)?

5. Besides, along with injections of seed electrons observed by GOES (lines 628-631), from the top two panels in Figure 2, the sudden enhancements of 600 and 900 keV electrons are also clearly visible after 7 UT with a factor of ~10. Therefore, inward radial diffusion cannot be simply excluded to account for the increases of ~1 MeV electrons at L~5.8 and more detailed discussions are needed.

6. Figure 6: please consider adding similar plots for some quiet time interval to highlight the EMIC effects in precipitation at L between 4.5 and 5. In this current version, the ratios between precipitation and trapped are not high at these L-shells.

7. Figure 10: any reason different normalized chorus frequencies are used for the two Panels: 0.15 for top and 0.31 for bottom? How much will it affect the f_ul curve in Figure 11?

Minor issues:
--colors are not used efficiently in such as Figure 11 to differentiate curves.
--discussion on GOES data (last paragraph in P5) needs proofreading, particularly the MLT and UT values.
--double check the dates in line 437.

Hello Vassilis,

Anton, Didier, and I have updated the figures and rewritten the title, abstract, introduction, conclusions, and the second paragraph of page 5, incorporating your comments throughout various sections.

In the introduction, we clarified that previous studies, including numerical simulations and analytical solutions by Man Hua (2022) and Didier (2023), have demonstrated that the final energy spectrum of relativistic electrons is highly dependent on the electron flux at 100-300 keV, which is determined by injections and serves as a lower boundary condition for the entire spectrum of relativistic electrons. This underscores the necessity of linking injections with chorus acceleration.

We also clarified that POES observations of ion isotropy boundary indicated the EMIC-driven precipitations right equatorward from the ion plasma sheet. Additionally, we have modified the discussion and conclusions to clearly separate the observational results from our interpretations and speculations.

Please find the revised version below.

All the best,
Zijin

Hi Vassilis,

Please find enclosed the new version of the document. Here are the main revisions:

	•	Acceleration in Abstract: I’ve introduced acceleration at the beginning of the abstract to enhance clarity.
	•	Terminology Consistency: I’ve streamlined the use of terminology, opting for a consistent name between “whistler-mode chorus” and “chorus” and introduced what they mean at the beginning for clarity.
	•	Title and Terminology Updates: The term “low-energy” has been suppressed in the title, and throughout the text, I’ve replaced “low-energy electron injections” with “~100-300 keV seed electron injections” (or “injections of…”), starting in the Abstract and Introduction.
	•	Electron Terminology: I’ve replaced “source” electrons with “seed” electrons throughout the document, ensuring no confusion for readers regarding these electrons.
	•	Introduction Enhancements: I’ve added to the Introduction that injections also provide “~1-100 keV source ions and electrons” that generate EMIC and whistler-mode waves.

I hope these changes align with your expectations. Please let me know if there are any further adjustments or feedback you have.

Best regards,
Zijin

Hi Anton, I have incorporated all V's comments. Something I have not yet resolved:

1. consistent defintion of relativistic electrons.
2. removal of some part (I think it is fair to remove but I am not sure)
3. other small changes (added to Overleaf) like the mechanism of other direct injection.

Please let me know if you have any further comments.

From Anton to Zijin:

You may send to Vassilis something like this:
Thank you for the last comments and suggestions! I included all of them, specifically
* in Introduction, where we now focus on the importance of the flux and PSD energy gradients needed to get a net increase (or decrease) of electron flux in the presence of chorus and EMIC wave-driven scattering (references to the Kennel-Petschek limit, less needed here, have been suppressed).
* in the Conclusions (last paragraph),  the mention of ULF inward diffusion and radial PSD gradient, which could have a similar effect, have been deleted.  
* the consistent definition of relativistic electrons have been included through the entire text.
I will submit the revised version tomorrow!

Hi Vassilis,

Thank you for your recent comments and suggestions. Anton, Didier, and I have incorporated all of them into the new version. Here are the key revisions:

1. Keep a consistent definition of relativistic electrons;
2. Emphasize the importance of the flux and PSD energy gradients necessary to achieve a net increase (or decrease) of electron flux in the presence of chorus and EMIC wave-driven scattering. As a result, references to the Kennel-Petschek limit, which were less essential, have been suppressed.
3. Remove certain parts to enhance clarity and coherence (e.g., the mention of ULF inward diffusion and radial PSD gradient, which could have a similar effect, have been deleted).

I plan to submit the revised version tomorrow. Please let me know if you have any additional feedback. I really appreciate your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,
Zijin
