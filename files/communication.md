Hello Vassilis,

Anton, Didier, and I have updated the figures and rewritten the title, abstract, introduction, conclusions, and the second paragraph of page 5, incorporating your comments throughout various sections.

In the introduction, we clarified that previous studies, including numerical simulations and analytical solutions by Man Hua (2022) and Didier (2023), have demonstrated that the final energy spectrum of relativistic electrons is highly dependent on the electron flux at 100-300 keV, which is determined by injections and serves as a lower boundary condition for the entire spectrum of relativistic electrons. This underscores the necessity of linking injections with chorus acceleration.

We also clarified that POES observations of ion isotropy boundary indicated the EMIC-driven precipitations right equatorward from the ion plasma sheet. Additionally, we have modified the discussion and conclusions to clearly separate the observational results from our interpretations and speculations.

Please find the revised version below.

All the best,
Zijin

Hi Vassilis,

Please find enclosed the new version of the document. Here are the main revisions:

	•	Acceleration in Abstract: I’ve introduced acceleration at the beginning of the abstract to enhance clarity.
	•	Terminology Consistency: I’ve streamlined the use of terminology, opting for a consistent name between “whistler-mode chorus” and “chorus” and introduced what they mean at the beginning for clarity.
	•	Title and Terminology Updates: The term “low-energy” has been suppressed in the title, and throughout the text, I’ve replaced “low-energy electron injections” with “~100-300 keV seed electron injections” (or “injections of…”), starting in the Abstract and Introduction.
	•	Electron Terminology: I’ve replaced “source” electrons with “seed” electrons throughout the document, ensuring no confusion for readers regarding these electrons.
	•	Introduction Enhancements: I’ve added to the Introduction that injections also provide “~1-100 keV source ions and electrons” that generate EMIC and whistler-mode waves.

I hope these changes align with your expectations. Please let me know if there are any further adjustments or feedback you have.

Best regards,
Zijin

Hi Anton, I have incorporated all V's comments. Something I have not yet resolved:

1. consistent defintion of relativistic electrons.
2. removal of some part (I think it is fair to remove but I am not sure)
3. other small changes (added to Overleaf) like the mechanism of other direct injection.

Please let me know if you have any further comments.

From Anton to Zijin:

You may send to Vassilis something like this:
Thank you for the last comments and suggestions! I included all of them, specifically
* in Introduction, where we now focus on the importance of the flux and PSD energy gradients needed to get a net increase (or decrease) of electron flux in the presence of chorus and EMIC wave-driven scattering (references to the Kennel-Petschek limit, less needed here, have been suppressed).
* in the Conclusions (last paragraph),  the mention of ULF inward diffusion and radial PSD gradient, which could have a similar effect, have been deleted.  
* the consistent definition of relativistic electrons have been included through the entire text.
I will submit the revised version tomorrow!

Hi Vassilis,

Thank you for your recent comments and suggestions. Anton, Didier, and I have incorporated all of them into the new version. Here are the key revisions:

1. Keep a consistent definition of relativistic electrons;
2. Emphasize the importance of the flux and PSD energy gradients necessary to achieve a net increase (or decrease) of electron flux in the presence of chorus and EMIC wave-driven scattering. As a result, references to the Kennel-Petschek limit, which were less essential, have been suppressed.
3. Remove certain parts to enhance clarity and coherence (e.g., the mention of ULF inward diffusion and radial PSD gradient, which could have a similar effect, have been deleted).

I plan to submit the revised version tomorrow. Please let me know if you have any additional feedback. I really appreciate your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,
Zijin
